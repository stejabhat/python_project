    <p><br>Indian heritage is the richness of Indian art, architecture, classical dance, music, flora, and wildlife,
         as well as the ingrained secular mindset of its people1.<br> <br>
        India has <u><i>42 UNESCO</i></u> World Heritage Sites that showcase its cultural and natural diversity.<br> <br>
        Some of the most famous heritage sites in India are the <strong>Taj Mahal, Khajuraho, Hampi, Ajanta Caves, Ellora Caves,
         Bodh Gaya, Sun Temple, and Red Fort Complex.</strong><br>Once Atal Ji said-
         <q> dream of an India that is prosperous, strong and caring. An India, that regains a place of honour in the comity of great nations. 
         You can change friends but not neighbours.</q>
